# TidyTuesday?

#TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project created by the R4DS online learning community that is focused on using tidyverse packages. A new dataset and accompanying article featuring an interesting plot is released on Github every Monday. The goal is to generate a copy of the original plot or create your own original approach.
